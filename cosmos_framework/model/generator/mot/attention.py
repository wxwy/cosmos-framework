    ``natten_metadata`` is provided and by dense self-attention otherwise, then merged

    FlexAttention is deliberately not one of those paths. Its output has to be copied

    ``merge_attentions`` relies on to fix up the branch backward, so the merged
    gradients came out wrong while the forward looked fine. The multiview supertoken

    ``[UND | GEN]`` stream in a single kernel and there is nothing to merge.

    When attention_meta is provided with null_action_supertokens=True, zeros V for the first
    num_action_tokens_per_supertoken tokens of each sample's GEN sequence (null action
    supertokens for temporal causal training). The metadata encodes is_causal=(True, False):
    causal across T supertokens, full within each supertoken S.

    NOTE: the three-way decomposition is only done so we can handle sparsity in the gen tower,
