    """Whether a pass over this pack needs the varlen (sequence-packed) attention API.

    True means the caller passes the ``cumulative_seqlen_*``/``max_seqlen_*`` metadata to
    :func:`attention`; False means it calls the dense API instead, with no ranges at all.

    With a single sample and no per-caption boundaries there is exactly one sequence in the
    pack, so that metadata is redundant and the dense API computes the same thing. Per-caption
    boundaries require the varlen API even for a single sample so causal self-attention keeps
    the captions independent. The same varlen decision is shared by both attention passes.

    The single-sample dense shortcut remains correct in the presence of trailing padding: for
    causal self-attention the mask never lets a real query attend to padded keys (padding is
    appended after all real tokens), the full path keeps the unpadded ``get_all_seq_unpadded``
    KV whenever this returns False (the dense API has no ranges to fence padding off with), and
    any padded query rows are independent of the real rows and simply discarded downstream.

    The dense path is gated to forward-only (inference) execution via ``torch.is_grad_enabled``,
    which is False under ``torch.no_grad()``/``torch.inference_mode()`` and True during training.
    This avoids branching on the sample count during training, where batch composition varies
    between single- and multi-sample packs; keeping a single code path there prevents
    torch.compile from specializing on both shapes and incurring the associated recompilation
    overhead.

    The grad-mode test precedes the sample-count comparison so that training never *compares*
    the count, since ``or`` stops at the first true operand. Obtaining the count costs no kernel and no device
    sync -- ``get_num_real_samples`` reads it off a shape -- but comparing it against a constant
    makes torch.compile specialize the enclosing graph on it, and a training run whose packs hold
    one sample sometimes and several other times then recompiles every layer on each count it
    meets. Inference wants the specialization and has a stable count.

    The comparison goes through ``guard_or_true`` because ``sample_offsets`` is marked unbacked
    before the compiled block (see ``parallelize_unified_mot._mark_pack_unbacked``), which leaves
    torch.compile no concrete value to compare against 1: ``mark_unbacked`` only establishes that
    the dim is not 0 or 1, and that does not settle the count's ``> 1``. A plain comparison
    therefore raises a data-dependent guard error on the inference path rather than picking a
    branch. ``torch._check`` cannot rescue it, since the only statement that would discharge the
    comparison ("every pack holds at least two samples") is false. ``guard_or_true`` resolves it
    whenever it *can* -- so a backed count keeps the specialization described above, unchanged --
    and otherwise falls back to varlen, which is the safe direction: as noted above, varlen
    metadata on a single-sample pack is redundant rather than wrong, so the fallback costs the
    dense path's optimization and nothing else.

    Args:
        num_samples: the pack's real sample count, from
            :func:`~cosmos_framework.data.generator.sequence_packing.runtime.get_num_real_samples`. It
            excludes the trailing pad segment, which is not a sequence the model was handed:
            counting it would take a one-sample pack to two and flip this to varlen.
        has_caption_offsets: whether the causal stream carries per-caption boundaries.
    Returns:
        bool: True to pass varlen metadata to :func:`attention`, False to use the dense API.

    Performs three-way attention, with understanding and generations attentions fully decomposed,
    and allows sparsity / multi-dimensional masking in the generation tower.

    The generation-tower self-attention (``full_sa``) is computed by NATTEN when
    ``natten_metadata`` is provided and by dense self-attention otherwise, then merged
    by log-sum-exp with the gen→und cross-attention (``full_ca``).

    FlexAttention is deliberately not one of those paths. Its output has to be copied
    into the heads-last layout, which breaks the data-pointer contract that
    ``merge_attentions`` relies on to fix up the branch backward, so the merged
    gradients came out wrong while the forward looked fine. The multiview supertoken
    mask lives on ``two_way_attention`` instead, where GEN queries take the whole
    ``[UND | GEN]`` stream in a single kernel and there is nothing to merge.

    When attention_meta is provided with null_action_supertokens=True, zeros V for the first
    num_action_tokens_per_supertoken tokens of each sample's GEN sequence (null action
    supertokens for temporal causal training). The metadata encodes is_causal=(True, False):
    causal across T supertokens, full within each supertoken S.

    NOTE: the three-way decomposition is only done so we can handle sparsity in the gen tower,
    but a KEY assumption is that the "full" tokens all correspond to the same modality!
    We should be careful when extending this to beyond t2i and t2v.

    ``packed_key_states_normalized``: optional alternative K pack for the gen→und cross-attention
    (``full_ca``).  When provided, its causal (und) stream supplies the und K tokens seen by the
    generator, while ``packed_key_states``' own causal stream (raw und K) is still used for the
    reasoner's own causal self-attention.  If ``None``, both paths share ``packed_key_states``.
