        model: The Cosmos3 VFM network.
        parallel_dims: Device mesh / parallelism descriptor. FSDP is applied whenever its
            ``dp_enabled`` holds, which for training includes a single-rank ``(1, 1)`` mesh
            -- at that degree the wrap buys no memory, but it is what installs ``mp_policy``,
            without which the parameters would be computed with in their storage dtype
            rather than cast down.
        compile_config: Compile switches (enabled, compiled_region, etc.).
        ac_config: Activation-checkpointing policy, typically
            ``OmniMoTModelConfig.activation_checkpointing``. Forwarded to
            ``parallelize_unified_mot`` for the decoder blocks, and applied here
            to the VFM-level modules in ``_AC_MODULE_ATTRS``.
        attention_io_layout: Tensor layout at the attention boundary under CP.
        mp_policy: FSDP2 mixed-precision policy applied to every FSDP unit (the
            per-decoder-layer ones inside ``parallelize_unified_mot`` and the root wrap
            here). ``None`` keeps FSDP2's default of no casting, i.e. compute and gradient
            reduction happen in the dtype the parameters are stored in. Pass
            ``MixedPrecisionPolicy(param_dtype=<compute dtype>, reduce_dtype=<param storage
            dtype>)`` to run a low-precision forward/backward over higher-precision
            parameters; the module must already hold its parameters in ``reduce_dtype``
